The following are a list of ideas to get started and thinking about how to continue to grow and build upon this project.


- Ensure responsive screen adaptation to make the Before I Die Code show up well on mobile and other screen sizes.
- Add React Native code to this project so that it can be used on mobile.
- Add a Maps page that pinpoints users to the location they identified in the JSON file.
- Add a clickable contribution page that displays all members who have contributed to the project.
- Add the ability for contributors to list other social media platforms for contact information and have that displayed when you click on the Before I Die Image.
- Before clicking on a contributor's avatar to direct the viewer to the user's profile, add a small GitHub image that will be displayed over the avatar image to let the user know where they will be taken when clicked.
- Once enough user data has been received, add Python code and libraries to extract data to display the most common or unique activities individuals want to do before they die.
- Enhance the user interface by changing the font of the Before I Die text that displays when clicking on a contributor's Before I Die image.
- Enhance the dummy images that show up when first visiting the website and have them change every time from a large library of images (could be from other previous contributors) to select from that represent unique and meaningful activities to complete before dying.
- Add a clickable page on the website that documents how to create a pull request and contribute to open source projects. This can be documented and YouTube links added to communicate well how to do this process.
- Add AI and other new technologies into this project from our community of contributors to test and also enhance the project with creative ideas.
- Create a feature that allows users to set reminders or notifications for their goals. This could help users stay on track and motivated to achieve their goals.
- Develop a system for tracking user progress and providing feedback or encouragement. This could involve gamification elements, such as badges or rewards for completing tasks.
- Create a feature that allows users to share their BEfore I Die on social media.
- Develop a system for tracking and displaying user contributions to the platform, such as code contributions or bug reports.
- Create a feature that allows users to connect with mentors or advisors who can provide guidance and support for achieving their goals.
- Develop a mobile app version with offline capability so users can access content on the go.
- Allow users to mark goals as "achieved" and share success stories.
Integrate with wearable devices like smart watches to track progress on fitness/health goals.
- Add data visualizations to showcase aggregate data on user goals and achievements.
- Build a bucket list generator that suggests goals based on user input like age, interests, location etc.
- Implement a badging/reward system for contributing and completing goals.
- Add a goal deadline and reminder feature so users can keep track.
- Build browser extension to capture goals/ideas and share quickly with BeforeIDie.
- Add multimedia options - videos, audio, images to augment text goals.
- Analyze data to identify trends and correlations between demographics, interests etc. and goals.
